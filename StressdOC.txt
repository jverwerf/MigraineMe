Stress Index — Methodology & Assumptions
Overview

The Stress Index is a deterministic, baseline-relative physiological index designed to capture autonomic nervous system deviation consistent with sustained psychological load, under explicitly constrained assumptions.

This metric is not a diagnostic tool, not a mental health assessment, and not a validated measure of subjective stress. It is a signal-level index derived solely from cardiovascular physiology.

What the Stress Index Measures

The Stress Index quantifies how far an individual’s daily autonomic state deviates from their recent personal baseline, using two primitive physiological signals:

Heart Rate Variability (HRV, RMSSD) — parasympathetic (vagal) tone

Resting Heart Rate (RHR) — sympathetic dominance / vagal withdrawal

The metric reflects physiological deviation, not causation. Elevated values indicate an autonomic state that is consistent with stress responses described in psychophysiological literature, but may also arise from unobserved confounders.

Explicit Exclusions (by design)

The Stress Index does not include:

Sleep metrics (handled as a separate domain)

Physical strain or activity metrics

Composite vendor scores (e.g. recovery)

Skin temperature or other context-sensitive signals

These exclusions are intentional to:

Avoid double counting

Avoid opaque weighting

Minimize confounding from environment, sleep, or exercise

Preserve interpretability and transparency

Scientific Framing

This metric is a signal detection index, not a predictive or causal model.

It does not:

Learn weights

Fit parameters

Optimize against outcomes

Use machine learning

Claim validation against ground truth stress

It does:

Apply fixed, reproducible transformations

Measure deviation from a personal physiological baseline

Treat signals symmetrically to minimize assumptions

Baseline Definition

For each user, a rolling baseline is computed over a recent window (e.g. 21–28 days):

Baseline location: median

Baseline scale: median absolute deviation (MAD)

Days with missing data or extreme anomalies may be excluded to improve robustness.

This process establishes what is normal for that individual and does not constitute model fitting or recalibration.

Directional Standardization

Physiological directionality is explicitly encoded:

Decreased HRV → unfavorable deviation

Increased RHR → unfavorable deviation

Daily standardized deviations are computed as:

ΔHRV = (HRV_baseline − HRV_today) / HRV_MAD
ΔRHR = (RHR_today − RHR_baseline) / RHR_MAD


This ensures all deviations are expressed on a common, dimensionless scale relative to individual variability.

Stress Index Calculation

The Stress Index is defined as the magnitude of deviation in standardized autonomic space:

StressIndex = √(ΔHRV² + ΔRHR²)


Key properties:

No explicit weights

No prioritization of signals

Contribution emerges from abnormality, not importance

Equivalent to distance from baseline equilibrium

This formulation avoids arbitrary weighting while allowing either signal to dominate when it deviates strongly.

Interpretation

Low values indicate autonomic states close to baseline

Higher values indicate increasing physiological deviation

Interpretation is within-person only, not population-normed

The Stress Index should be interpreted as:

“How unusual is today’s autonomic state for this individual?”

Not:

“How stressed is this person in absolute terms?”

Limitations (Non-negotiable)

The Stress Index:

Cannot distinguish mental stress from illness, injury, alcohol, travel, or other unobserved factors

Lacks contextual awareness (e.g. work vs leisure)

Does not capture subjective experience

Is not validated against self-report or biomarkers

As such, it should be treated as a supporting physiological signal, not a definitive measure.

Terminology Guidance

Recommended:

Stress Index

Physiological Stress Signal

Autonomic Deviation Index

Avoid:

“Mental stress score”

“Stress prediction”

“ML-based stress”

“Stress level”

Summary

The Stress Index is a conservative, transparent, and scientifically honest metric that reflects baseline-relative autonomic deviation using minimal assumptions and primitive signals only. It prioritizes interpretability and methodological integrity over ambition.
